# [Springroll.io](https://springroll.io/)

Repository for the [springroll.io](https://springroll.io/) site. Due to a issue with how Github pages are hosted, the source code and the built version of [springroll.io](https://springroll.io/) can't be in the same repository. To update [springroll.io](https://springroll.io/) you must push the built version of springroll.io to the [deployment repository](https://github.com/SpringRoll/SpringRoll.github.io).

## Commands

### serve - Runs the dev server

### build - Builds site for deployment
