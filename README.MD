# [Springroll.io](https://springroll.io/)

This is the repository for the [springroll.io](https://springroll.io/) site. Due to an issue with Github's hosting practices, the source code and the built version of [springroll.io](https://springroll.io/) can't be in the same repository. To update [springroll.io](https://springroll.io/), you must push the built version of [springroll.io](https://springroll.io/) to the [deployment repository](https://github.com/SpringRoll/SpringRoll.github.io)

## Commands

### serve - Runs the dev server

### build - Builds site for deployment


## Notes
### SafeScaleManagerDemo
To get this to work properly you'll have to update the path names.
e.g.
`src="main.js"` => `src="/SafeScaleManagerDemo/main.js"`

You'll also have to edit main.js directly to update the path for the Springroll logo
